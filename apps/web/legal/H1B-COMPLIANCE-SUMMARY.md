# H1B Compliance Summary - Adaptive Courses

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** PRE-LAUNCH - COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE DEFINED

---

## Executive Summary

Rahul D'Costa is on an H1B visa, which **prohibits working for his own company**. However, he **can be a passive investor**.

This document summarizes the legal structure designed to:
1. Allow Rahul to receive passive investment returns (90-95% of profits)
2. Ensure full H1B compliance (zero management authority)
3. Protect against immigration violations that could jeopardize status

---

## The Structure

### Manager-Managed LLC

**Entity:** [COMPANY NAME LLC] - Delaware Limited Liability Company

**Members:**
- **US Citizen Co-Founder:** 5-10% equity → **Managing Member**
  - Has 100% operational control
  - Makes all business decisions
  - Signs all contracts
  - Hires/fires employees
  - Manages day-to-day operations

- **Rahul D'Costa:** 90-95% equity → **Passive Member**
  - Has ZERO management authority
  - Cannot participate in operations
  - Cannot sign contracts
  - Cannot hire/fire
  - Receives profit distributions only

### Why This Works

**Legal Precedent:**
- Rapportive (3 H1B co-founders) used this structure → acquired by LinkedIn
- Many Y Combinator companies use manager-managed LLCs
- Key: H1B holder must be **fireable by the board**

**Immigration-Safe:**
- Rahul is NOT an employee (no W-2, no salary)
- Rahul is a passive investor (receives K-1 distributions)
- Operating Agreement explicitly prohibits management participation
- Immigration attorney reviewed structure

- Operating Agreement can be amended post-green card

### Exit Scenarios

**If Company is Acquired:**
- Rahul receives 90-95% of sale proceeds (passive capital gains)
- No work required for sale process
- Tax treatment: long-term capital gains (favorable)

**If Company Raises Funding:**
- Rahul's passive percentage dilutes with new investors
- Can participate in funding rounds (passive investment)
- Investors will review structure (immigration attorney letter helps)
