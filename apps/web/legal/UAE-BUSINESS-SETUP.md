4. **Submit documents** (passport, Emirates ID, business plan)
5. **Get license** (1-2 weeks)
6. **Open bank account** (Emirates NBD, Mashreq, RAKBank)
7. **Register for VAT** (if revenue >AED 375K = ~$102K/year)

---

## Tax Obligations in UAE

### Corporate Tax (Effective June 2023)
**New UAE Corporate Tax Law:**
- **0% tax** on profits up to AED 375,000 (~$102,000/year)
- **9% tax** on profits above AED 375,000

**For you:**
- If revenue <$100K/year → 0% tax
- If revenue >$100K/year → 9% on profits above threshold

**Free zone exemption:**
- Some free zones may qualify for 0% tax (pending regulations)
- Check with DMCC/DIFC when setting up

---

### VAT (Value Added Tax)
**Rate:** 5%

**Registration required if:**
- Revenue >AED 375,000 (~$102K/year) - Mandatory
- Revenue >AED 187,500 (~$51K/year) - Voluntary

**For you:**
- Start without VAT registration (under threshold)
- Register when you hit $100K/year revenue
- Charge 5% VAT to UAE customers (if registered)
- Claim back VAT on expenses

**International customers:**
- 0% VAT (export of services)
- Most of your revenue will be international → likely 0% VAT

---

### Personal Income Tax
**Rate:** 0%

No personal income tax in UAE. All revenue you take as salary/dividends is tax-free.

---

## Payment Processing Considerations

### Stripe in UAE
**Status:** Stripe Atlas not available for UAE companies

**Workaround:**
- **Option A:** Register Stripe account in US (need US entity - see below)
- **Option B:** Use Stripe Europe (need EU entity)
- **Option C:** Use UAE payment gateway (Network International, Telr, PayTabs)

**Recommended:** Keep US entity for Stripe, or use Stripe Europe via UAE company.

### Current Setup (if using Stripe)
If you're already using Stripe:
- **Keep it** (Stripe doesn't require you to be in same jurisdiction)
- Update business details to UAE address (if they allow)
- OR maintain dual structure (UAE company + US LLC for Stripe only)

---

## Dual Structure: UAE + US LLC (Optional)

### Scenario
- **UAE Free Zone Company:** Main operating entity, your salary
- **US LLC (Wyoming/Delaware):** Stripe payments only, flow profits to UAE

**Why:**
- Stripe works easily with US entities
- UAE company is your "real" business (employment, visa)
- US LLC acts as payment processor (no employees, minimal activity)

**Tax:**
- US LLC: 0% federal tax (pass-through entity, no US-sourced income)
- UAE Company: 0-9% on profits (depending on threshold)
- You personally: 0% (UAE resident, no personal income tax)

**Costs:**
- UAE: AED 30K-95K/year (~$8K-26K)
- US LLC: $300-1,000/year (registered agent, annual report)

---

## Banking in UAE

### Best Banks for Startups
1. **Emirates NBD** - Digital-friendly, fast setup
2. **Mashreq Neo** - Fintech-friendly, good for SaaS
3. **RAKBank** - Easier account opening
4. **ADCB** - Solid option

### Requirements
- Trade license (from free zone)
- Passport + Emirates ID
- Proof of address (utility bill)
- Initial deposit: AED 0-25,000 (varies by bank)

### Timeline
- 1-2 weeks after license approval

### International Transfers
- SWIFT transfers: Easy (2-3 days, ~AED 50-100 fee)
- Wise/Revolut: Works for receiving payments
- PayPal: Available but not ideal for business

---

## Domain & Website Implications

### Current Domain
**adaptivecourses.ai** - Already purchased

**Entity on website:**
- Update Terms of Service to reflect UAE company
- Update Privacy Policy (GDPR still applies - see below)

### GDPR Compliance
Even though you're in UAE:
- **GDPR applies** if you have EU customers (you do)
- Must comply with EU data protection rules
- Supabase (your backend) is GDPR-compliant
- Privacy Policy must mention GDPR rights
