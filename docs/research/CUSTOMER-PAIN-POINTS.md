## Implications for Adaptive Courses

### Marketing Copy Should Emphasize:
1. **Speed:** "30-60 minutes, not 40 hours"
2. **Urgency:** "Prep for tomorrow's meeting"
3. **Personalization:** "Exactly what YOU need, nothing more"
4. **Outcome:** "Walk in confident"
5. **No subscription:** "Pay once, learn once"
6. **No decision fatigue:** "We generate the course FOR you"

### Product Design Should:
1. Make courses completable in one sitting
2. Frontload the most important 20%
3. Include actionable takeaways
4. Match specific scenarios (factory visit, interview, presentation)
5. No upsells or subscription traps
6. Clear outcome promise

### Positioning:
- **Not a competitor to Udemy/Coursera** (different use case)
- **Complementary:** "Use Udemy for mastery, use us for urgency"
- **New category:** "Just-in-time learning" / "AI crash courses"
