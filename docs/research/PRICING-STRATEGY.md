## Pricing Psychology

### $5 vs $7 vs $10 Analysis

**$5 Price Point:**
- **Pros:**
  - Impulse buy territory (coffee price comparison)
  - Low barrier to trial
  - "No-brainer" pricing
  - High volume potential
  
- **Cons:**
  - May signal low quality
  - Leaves money on the table
  - Low perceived value
  - Hard to sustain with AI API costs
  
- **Customer psychology:** "It's just $5, why not?"
- **Risk:** Customers expect minimal value

---

**$7 Price Point:**
- **Pros:**
  - Still impulse buy range
  - Slightly more premium than $5
  - Odd number = feels calculated/specific (not arbitrary)
  - 40% more revenue than $5
  
- **Cons:**
  - Not as "round" as $10
  - May seem random without explanation
  
- **Customer psychology:** "Specific pricing = thoughtful product"
- **Sweet spot:** Good balance of accessibility + value signal

---

**$10 Price Point:**
- **Pros:**
  - Round number, easy to remember
  - Premium positioning without being expensive
  - Comparable to Blinkist, MasterClass monthly
  - Room for discounts (launch at $7, "normally $10")
  
- **Cons:**
  - Requires more conviction from buyer
  - Crosses psychological $10 barrier
  - May lose impulse buyers
  
- **Customer psychology:** "Worth it IF it solves my problem"
- **Positioning:** Premium, high-quality, curated

---

## Pay-Per-Course vs. Subscription Models

### Pay-Per-Course (Recommended for MVP)

**Pros:**
- No subscription fatigue
- Clean, simple value prop: "Pay for what you need"
- Lower commitment = easier first purchase
- Matches use case: urgency, not ongoing learning
- No churn management complexity
- Fair pricing (only pay when you use)

**Cons:**
- Lower lifetime value per customer
- No recurring revenue
- Customer has to "buy again" each time

**When it works:**
- Sporadic, event-driven use cases (job interview, client meeting)
- Customers value flexibility over unlimited access
- Product is "as-needed" not "daily habit"

**Best for Adaptive Courses because:**
- Use case is urgent but infrequent
- Customers want just-in-time, not just-in-case
- Matches mental model: "I need to learn X for Y event"

---

### Subscription Model

**Pros:**
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Higher lifetime value
- Lower per-use cost (good for power users)
- Encourages habitual use

**Cons:**
- Subscription fatigue (customers tired of monthly charges)
- Churn management overhead
- Requires high engagement to retain
- May not match sporadic use case

**When it works:**
- Daily/weekly use (Duolingo, Brilliant)
- High-volume users (consultants, career changers)
- Bundled value (unlimited courses)

**Potential Future Tier:**
- "Pro" subscription: $20/month, unlimited courses
- Targets consultants, career changers, heavy learners

---

## Recommended Pricing Model

### MVP Launch Pricing: **$7 per course**

**Rationale:**
1. **Above $5:** Signals quality, not a throwaway product
2. **Below $10:** Still impulse-buy territory
3. **Odd number:** Feels intentional, not arbitrary
4. **API cost coverage:** Leaves margin after Claude API costs (~$1-3/course)
5. **Comparison anchors:**
   - Less than Udemy "sale price" ($9.99)
   - Less than a single Coursera module ($29+)
   - More than a coffee ($5)
   - Same as a book summary app (Blinkist ~$10/month but one-time)

**Positioning:**
- "Premium crash course for less than a Chipotle burrito"
- "One course, one problem, $7"

---

## Pricing Experiments to Run

### A/B Test Ideas (Post-Launch)
1. **$7 vs $10** - Does higher price reduce conversions?
2. **Pay-per-course vs $20/month unlimited** - Which has better LTV?
3. **"$7" vs "Less than a burrito"** - Does comparison anchor help?
4. **Bundling:** Offer 3-pack at checkout vs single purchase only

### Price Sensitivity Testing
- Survey after first purchase: "Would you have paid more?"
- Track conversion rate by price point
- Analyze: Does $10 attract higher-intent customers?

---

## Psychological Pricing Tactics

### Anchoring
- "Typical Coursera course: $49. Our AI crash course: $7."
- "40-hour Udemy course: $14.99. Our 1-hour course: $7."

### Value Framing
- "$7 to walk into your meeting confident"
- "Less than a lunch, more valuable than a day of Googling"

### Scarcity (Use Sparingly)
- "Launch pricing: $5 for first 100 customers" (real scarcity, not fake urgency)

### Social Proof
- "1,000+ professionals prepped for interviews, meetings, and presentations"
- "Avg. rating: 4.8/5"

### Risk Reversal
- "Try it. If you don't feel more confident, email us for a refund."
- Low risk = higher conversion

- **Annual Revenue:** $56,400
- **Higher LTV, lower churn**
