# Presentation Deck Skill

Create compelling presentation content for Adaptive Courses - investor decks, product demos, team updates.

## Deck Types

### Investor Pitch Deck
Standard 10-12 slide structure:
1. **Title** - Company name, tagline, your name
2. **Problem** - The pain point (make it visceral)
3. **Solution** - What Adaptive Courses does (demo screenshot)
4. **Market** - TAM/SAM/SOM with sources
5. **Product** - How it works (3 key features)
6. **Traction** - Users, revenue, growth metrics
7. **Business Model** - How you make money
8. **Competition** - Positioning matrix
9. **Team** - Why you'll win
10. **Ask** - What you need, what you'll do with it
11. **Appendix** - Detailed financials, tech stack

### Product Demo Deck
5-7 slides:
1. **Hook** - The transformation promise
2. **Before/After** - Life without vs with Adaptive Courses
3. **Demo Flow** - Step-by-step with screenshots
4. **Use Cases** - 3 specific scenarios
5. **Pricing** - Clear, simple
6. **CTA** - What to do next

### Team Update Deck
4-6 slides:
1. **Wins** - What shipped, what worked
2. **Metrics** - Key numbers, trends
3. **Learnings** - What we discovered
4. **Next** - Priorities for next period
5. **Asks** - What you need from the team

## Slide Writing Rules

**One idea per slide.** If you need "and" in your title, split it.

**Titles are takeaways.** Not "Market Size" but "EdTech is a $400B market growing 16% annually"

**Bullet points:**
- Maximum 4 per slide
- Each under 10 words
- Start with action verbs

**Numbers:**
- Round them (not $3,847,291 but $3.8M)
- Add context ("+127% vs last quarter")
- Highlight the impressive ones

## Anti-Patterns

- Walls of text (if you're reading it, it's wrong)
- Clip art or stock photos of people pointing at screens
- Generic "synergy" business speak
- Too many slides (investor deck > 12 slides = automatic skepticism)
- Hiding bad news (address it, spin it, move on)

## Adaptive Courses Specific Content

**Our story hook:**
"Traditional online courses teach everyone the same way. A factory worker learning for a job interview and a student cramming for finals get identical content. Adaptive Courses creates personalized learning that understands your situation, not just your skill level."

**Key differentiators:**
1. Situational context (why you're learning matters)
2. AI-generated but human-quality content
3. $3.99 per course (10x cheaper than alternatives)

**Traction points to include:**
- Waitlist signups
- Courses generated
- User feedback quotes
- Completion rates vs industry average

## Output Format

When creating a deck, provide:
1. Slide-by-slide outline with titles and bullet points
2. Speaker notes for each slide
3. Suggested visuals/screenshots for each slide
4. Estimated speaking time per slide
