# Marketing Skill

Create marketing content, plans, and copy for Adaptive Courses.

## Brand Voice

**Tone:** Confident but not cocky. Smart but accessible. Warm, not corporate.

**We say:**
- "Learn what you need, when you need it"
- "Courses that understand your situation"
- "AI-powered, human-quality"

**We don't say:**
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing" / "Disruptive"
- "Synergy" / "Leverage" / "Optimize"
- "Best-in-class" / "World-class" / "Industry-leading"

**Voice examples:**

Bad: "Our revolutionary AI platform leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize your learning journey."

Good: "Tell us why you're learning. We'll create a course that actually makes sense for your situation."

## Content Types

### Landing Page Copy
Structure:
1. **Hero:** Clear value prop + CTA (above fold)
2. **Problem:** Agitate the pain
3. **Solution:** How we solve it
4. **Social proof:** Testimonials, numbers
5. **Features:** 3 key benefits with visuals
6. **Pricing:** Simple, transparent
7. **FAQ:** Address objections
8. **Final CTA:** Urgency if appropriate

### Email Sequences

**Waitlist nurture (5 emails):**
1. Welcome + what to expect
2. The problem we're solving (story)
3. Behind the scenes (build in public)
4. Early access preview
5. Launch announcement

**Post-purchase (3 emails):**
1. Thank you + quick start
2. Tips for getting the most out of your course
3. Feedback request + referral ask

### Social Media

**Twitter/X:**
- Hooks that create curiosity
- Thread structure: hook → story → insight → CTA
- Use "you" not "we"
- 280 chars max for standalone posts

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional but human
- Personal stories > company announcements
- End with questions to drive engagement

## Marketing Plan Template

When creating a marketing plan, include:

1. **Objective:** What are we trying to achieve? (specific, measurable)
2. **Audience:** Who are we targeting? (be specific)
3. **Channels:** Where will we reach them?
4. **Content:** What will we create?
5. **Timeline:** When does each piece ship?
6. **Budget:** What will it cost?
7. **Metrics:** How will we measure success?
8. **Risks:** What could go wrong?

## Competitive Positioning

- Us: Personalized to your specific situation

**Us vs. AI Tutors (ChatGPT, etc.):**
- They: Unstructured, chat-based learning
- Us: Structured curriculum with quizzes and progression

**Us vs. Expensive Bootcamps:**
- They: $5,000+ commitment

## Headlines That Work

Formula: [Outcome] + [Timeframe/Ease] + [Uniqueness]

Examples:
- "Learn React in 2 hours—customized for your job interview tomorrow"
- "Finally understand machine learning (without the math PhD)"
- "The course that asks why you're learning before teaching you how"

## Anti-Patterns

- Generic stock photos of diverse people smiling at laptops
- "Join 10,000+ learners" when we have 100
- Fake urgency ("Only 3 spots left!")
- Claiming features we don't have
- Comparing to competitors by name (unless asked)
