### Refund Requests
**Subject:** Re: Refund Request for [Course Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm sorry the course didn't meet your expectations. I've processed your refund - you should see $5 back in your account within 5-7 business days.

Can you help me understand what was missing? Your feedback helps us improve:
- Was the content too shallow/deep?
- Wrong tone/approach?
- Technical issues?
- Something else?

Thanks for trying Adaptive Courses.

Best,
Rahul

### Course Quality Issues
**Subject:** Re: Issue with [Course Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for flagging this. You're absolutely right - [acknowledge the issue].

I'm regenerating your course with better prompts. You'll get the updated version in the next 10 minutes, and I've also credited your account with a free course.

Let me know if the new version works better!

Best,
Rahul

### Technical Problems
**Subject:** Re: Technical Issue

Hi [Name],

Sorry you're running into issues! A few quick things to try:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Try a different browser

If none of those work, can you send me:
- Browser & version
- Screenshot of any error messages
- What step you were on

I'll get this fixed ASAP.

Best,
Rahul

### Feature Requests
**Subject:** Re: Feature Request - [Feature]

Hi [Name],

Great idea! I love the [specific aspect] of your suggestion.

I'm adding this to our roadmap. Quick question: would you use this feature if we built it within [timeframe]?

Also, if you're interested in early access when we ship it, I'll add you to our beta tester list.

Thanks for helping us build a better product!

Best,
Rahul

### Can't Generate Course
**Subject:** Re: Course Generation Failed

Hi [Name],

Sorry about that! This usually happens when:
1. Our AI service is temporarily down (rare)
2. The topic is very niche/new
3. Network timeout

I've manually triggered a regeneration for "[topic]" - you should have it in your inbox within 5 minutes.

If it fails again, we'll issue a full refund immediately.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Best,
Rahul
