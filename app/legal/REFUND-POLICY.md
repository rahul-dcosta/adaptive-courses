This Refund Policy explains when refunds are available and how to request them.

---

## Summary

**Per-Course Purchases ($3.99):**  
❌ **No refunds** after course is delivered (digital goods are non-refundable)  
✅ **Refund available** if technical error prevents delivery (within 7 days)

**Pro Subscription ($9.99/month or $99/year):**  
❌ **No refunds** for subscription fees (pro-rated cancellation not available)  
✅ **Access continues** until end of current billing period after cancellation

**Exceptions:**  
Extraordinary circumstances (prolonged outage, fundamental service failure) may qualify for refunds at our discretion.

## 1. Per-Course Purchases

### 1.1 No Refunds After Delivery

**All per-course purchases ($3.99 each) are final and non-refundable** once the course has been:
- Successfully generated by our AI
- Delivered to your account
- Made accessible in your course library

**Why?** Because:
- Course content is digital and delivered instantly
- You receive full, permanent access to the course immediately
- Once delivered, the course cannot be "returned"
- AI generation costs are incurred at the time of creation

### 1.2 Technical Failure Exception

**Refunds ARE available** if:
- Our system fails to generate your course
- Technical error prevents delivery to your account
- Course content is corrupted or unreadable
- Payment was charged but no course was delivered

**To request a refund for technical failure:**
1. Contact us at **support@adaptivecourses.com** within **7 days** of purchase
2. Include your order number and description of the issue
3. We will investigate and issue a refund if the failure is confirmed
4. Refunds are processed within 5-10 business days

### 1.3 Quality Concerns

If you are dissatisfied with the quality of a generated course:
- **We cannot offer refunds** (digital goods policy)
- We **can offer alternatives:**
  - Regenerate the course with different parameters (free)
  - Provide guidance on how to improve results
  - Offer credit toward a future course (case-by-case basis)

**Prevention:** We encourage users to:
- Start with the **Free Tier** (1 free course) to test quality
- Provide detailed inputs for better course generation
- Review the course outline before full generation (when available)
