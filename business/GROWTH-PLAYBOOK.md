## When to Quit a Channel

**Quit if:**
- 3 months of effort, <10 customers
- CAC >$20 (not sustainable at $5 price)
- Time investment doesn't justify ROI

If Reddit posts take 2 hours each and generate 0 customers after 10 posts → quit Reddit.

## When to Double Down

**Double down if:**
- Channel produces customers at CAC <$5
- Conversion rate >3%
- Users from this channel have high LTV
- Scalable (not capped)

**Example:**
If LinkedIn posts generate 20 customers/month organically → post daily, test LinkedIn Ads.

## Rule of Thumb

**80/20 rule:**
- 80% of customers will come from 20% of channels
- Find those 20%, double down
- Don't spread too thin

**For us, likely winners:**
- Product Hunt (launch spike)
- LinkedIn (professional audience)
