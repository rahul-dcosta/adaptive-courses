## First Comment Template (Your Story)

**Title:** "I built this because I kept Googling 'learn X fast' and found nothing"

**Structure:**
1. **The Problem (Personal Story)**
   - "Two months ago, I had a client meeting about blockchain in 8 hours and knew nothing about crypto."
   - "I Googled 'blockchain crash course' and found 40-hour Udemy courses."
   - "I needed 1 hour of learning, not 40."

2. **The Insight**
   - "Realized there's a gap: just-in-time learning doesn't exist."
   - "Before job interviews, client meetings, presentations - we need speed, not depth."

3. **The Solution**
   - "So I built Adaptive Courses: type in what you need to learn, why, and when."
   - "In 60 seconds, you get a personalized 30-60 min crash course."
   - "No fluff, no 40-hour commitment - just the essentials."

4. **How It Works**
   - "Enter topic: e.g., 'blockchain basics for client meeting' or 'React fundamentals for job interview'"
   - "AI generates a custom course: modules, flashcards, actionable takeaways"
   - "Learn in 30-60 min, walk into your meeting confident"

5. **Who It's For**
   - "Consultants prepping for client meetings"
   - "Job seekers brushing up before interviews"
   - "Presenters learning a new topic overnight"
   - "Anyone who needs to sound intelligent fast"

6. **What's Next**
   - "This is v1. I'd love feedback on:"
   - "- What topics would you use this for?"
   - "- What's missing?"
   - "- Would you pay $7 for this?"

7. **Ask**
   - "Try it out and let me know what you think!"
   - "Any feedback is gold at this stage. 🙏"
