**LinkedIn Post:**
> 🚀 Excited to share: I just launched Adaptive Courses on Product Hunt!
> 
> **The problem I was solving:**

> - Job seekers brushing up before interviews
> - Presenters learning a new topic overnight
> - Anyone facing "I need to sound intelligent tomorrow" moments

> 
> I'd love your feedback - check it out: [link]
> 
> And if you've ever Googled "learn X fast" and found nothing helpful, I built this for you.

## Best Practices for Outreach

### Do's:
✅ Personalize every message (mention their work, not just copy-paste)
✅ Be genuine and humble (not salesy)
✅ Offer value first (feedback, help) before asking
✅ Follow up once, then move on (don't spam)
✅ Thank everyone who helps

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't spam the same message to 100 people
❌ Don't be entitled ("you should support me")
❌ Don't ask for upvotes before launch (against PH rules)
❌ Don't follow up more than twice
❌ Don't ignore people who help you

---

**Remember:** People support products they believe in, not just because you asked. Make your ask easy (upvote takes 2 seconds), explain why it matters, and be genuinely grateful for any support. 🙏
