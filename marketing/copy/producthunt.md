## Tagline
AI courses that understand your situation, not just your skill level.

## Short Description (60 chars)
Custom learning paths in 30 seconds. $5 per course.

## Description (Full)

### The Problem
You have a factory tour tomorrow. Or a job interview next week. Or you're switching careers and need to sound smart fast.

You Google the topic. You get:
- 47 browser tabs
- 3-hour YouTube documentaries  
- Generic "beginner" courses that teach you everything

But you don't need everything. You need *exactly what you need* for *your specific situation*.

### The Solution
Adaptive Courses generates custom learning paths in 30 seconds using AI.

Instead of asking "What's your skill level?" (boring), we ask:

✨ **What's the situation?**  
Visiting a factory | Job interview | Career switch | Just curious

⏰ **When do you need this?**  
Tomorrow 🔥 | This week | No rush

🎯 **What's the goal?**  
Sound smart | Ask good questions | Actually understand it

Then Claude generates a custom course with modules, lessons, and quizzes — tailored to YOUR context.

### How It Works
1. Tell us what you want to learn (e.g., "manufacturing")
2. Answer 3 quick button-based questions (10 seconds)
3. Your custom course generates in 30 seconds
4. Learn online, download PDF, or get via email

### Pricing
$5 per course. One-time payment. No subscription.

(First 100 users get it for $3 with code HUNTER)

### Why We Built This
Traditional courses teach you like you have infinite time.

But real life doesn't work that way.

Sometimes you need to learn "just enough" to:
- Not embarrass yourself at a factory tour
- Ask smart questions in a job interview
- Sound conversational when switching careers

That's what we built.

### What You Get
- Custom curriculum (3-5 modules)
- Detailed lessons (200-300 words each)
- Quick quizzes to test understanding
- Estimated learning time
- Next steps & resources
- PDF export
- Email delivery

### Who This Is For
✅ Professionals visiting client sites  
✅ Job seekers prepping for interviews  
✅ Career switchers needing quick ramp-up  
✅ Curious learners with learning emergencies  
✅ Anyone who needs to learn something FAST

### Tech Stack

## First Comment (Maker Intro)

👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Rahul, and I built Adaptive Courses to solve a problem I had last week.

I had a factory tour in 24 hours and knew NOTHING about manufacturing.

Googling gave me information overload. ChatGPT gave me walls of text. Online courses wanted me to commit to 10 hours.

I just needed to learn "just enough" to:
- Know the basic vocab
- Ask good questions
- Not look clueless

So I built this.

**The insight:** The right question isn't "What's your skill level?"  
It's "What's the situation?"

Because learning for a job interview is different than learning out of curiosity.

The app asks 3 quick questions (buttons, not typing), then Claude generates a custom course in 30 seconds.

$5 per course. No subscription. No fluff.

We launched 2 days ago and have had [X] courses generated so far.

**I'd love your feedback on:**
- The button-based onboarding (is it too limiting?)
- The $5 price point (too cheap? too expensive?)
- What topics you'd want to learn about

Try it and let me know what you think! 🙏

## FAQs

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**  
A: ChatGPT gives you text. We give you structured courses with modules, lessons, quizzes, and a learning path. Plus, we ask the RIGHT questions to understand your context.

**Q: Can I request refunds?**  
A: Yes! If you're not happy with the course, email us within 24 hours for a full refund.

**Q: What topics can I learn?**  
A: Anything! Manufacturing, supply chain, nuclear energy, sales frameworks, you name it.

**Q: How long are the courses?**  
A: Depends on your timeline selection. "Tomorrow" courses are shorter and more tactical. "No rush" courses go deeper.

**Q: Do you save my data?**  
A: We save your email and generated courses. We don't sell your data or spam you.

**Q: Will you add subscriptions?**  
A: Not planning to. We like the "pay per course" model. Keeps it simple.

**Q: Can I share courses?**  
A: You can share the PDF! We might add a "public course library" later.

## Twitter Thread (Cross-Promotion)

🧵 I just launched Adaptive Courses on Product Hunt

AI-generated learning paths that understand your SITUATION, not just your skill level

Here's how it works 👇

Traditional online courses ask: "What's your skill level?"

Beginner? Intermediate? Advanced?

But that's the WRONG question.

Because learning for a job interview is different than learning out of curiosity.

(2/7)

Adaptive Courses asks:

✨ What's the situation? (factory visit, job interview, career switch)
⏰ When do you need this? (tomorrow, this week, no rush)
🎯 What's the goal? (sound smart, ask questions, understand)

3 button clicks. That's it.
