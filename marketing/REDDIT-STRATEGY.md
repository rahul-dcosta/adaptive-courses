## Posting Strategy by Community Type

### For r/InternetIsBeautiful (17M)

**Title Format:**
- "A website that generates a custom 30-minute course on any topic using AI"
- "Learn anything in 30 minutes - AI generates personalized crash courses"

**Post Body:**
```markdown
I built a site that generates personalized courses in 30 seconds using AI.

URL: https://adaptivecourses.ai

You tell it:
- What you want to learn (e.g., "blockchain for beginners")
- Your situation (job interview tomorrow, just curious, career switch)
- When you need it (urgent vs. casual)

It creates a 30-minute course tailored to your context.

Not just "beginner" or "advanced" - it adapts to WHY you're learning.

Examples:
- "Supply chain basics for a factory visit tomorrow"
- "React fundamentals for a job interview this week"
- "Coffee brewing methods (just curious)"

Free tier: 1 course
$3.99: Buy individual courses
$7.99/mo: Unlimited

Built with Next.js + Claude Sonnet 4.5. Feedback welcome!
```

**Best Time to Post:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM EST

### For r/SideProject (430K)

**Title Format:**
- "I built an AI that generates custom courses in 30 seconds (Next.js + Claude)"
- "Adaptive Courses: Learn anything in 30 minutes (AI-powered)"

**Post Body:**
```markdown
**What I built:** Adaptive Courses - AI-generated crash courses

**Live:** https://adaptivecourses.ai

**The idea:**
I kept Googling "learn X fast" and found 40-hour Udemy courses. I needed 30 minutes, not 40 hours.

**How it works:**
1. Tell it what you want to learn + your context (job interview, factory visit, just curious)
2. AI generates a custom 30-minute course in 30 seconds
3. Includes modules, key takeaways, examples

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (course generation)
- Supabase (database)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vercel (hosting)

**Pricing:**
- Free: 1 course
- $3.99: Pay per course
- $7.99/mo: Unlimited

**What I'd love feedback on:**
- Does the pricing make sense?
- What topics would you generate?
- UI/UX improvements?

Built in 2 weeks. Happy to answer questions about the build!
```

**Best Time to Post:** Saturday-Sunday, 10 AM-2 PM EST (weekend builders)

### For r/Entrepreneur (4.8M)

**Title Format:**
- "How I learn new industries in 30 minutes (for client meetings, job interviews, etc.)"
- "I built a tool to solve 'I need to learn X by tomorrow' problem"

**Post Body:**
```markdown
**Context:** I'm a consultant. Every week I prep for client meetings on industries I know nothing about.

**The problem:** Udemy = 40 hours. YouTube = scattered info. Books = too slow.

**What I needed:** 30 minutes to learn enough to sound intelligent.

**What I built:** https://adaptivecourses.ai

It's an AI that generates custom crash courses based on YOUR situation:
- Job interview tomorrow? → Interview-focused course
- Factory visit this week? → Practical, visual learning
- Just curious? → Exploratory, deep dive

**Real use cases I've had:**
- Supply chain basics (client meeting in 8 hours)
- Blockchain fundamentals (job interview prep)
- Warehouse management (factory tour tomorrow)

**Pricing:**
$3.99 per course or $7.99/mo unlimited

**For entrepreneurs:**
- Learn competitor's industry fast
- Prep for investor meetings
- Upskill for new market entry
- Understand customer's domain

Curious if this resonates with other entrepreneurs here.
```

**Best Time to Post:** Monday morning (goal-setting day) or Friday afternoon (planning weekend work)

### For r/indiehackers (91K)

**Title Format:**
- "Launched: Adaptive Courses - AI crash courses that understand context ($3.99/course)"
- "Building in public: $XXX MRR in Week 1 with AI course generator"

**Post Body:**
```markdown
**Product:** Adaptive Courses
**URL:** https://adaptivecourses.ai
**Traction:** [update with real numbers]

**What it does:**
Generates personalized 30-minute courses using Claude AI. Not just "beginner/advanced" - adapts to WHY you're learning.

**The insight:**
Traditional courses ask "What's your skill level?"

But learning for a job interview is different than learning for fun.

So we ask:
- What's the situation? (interview, career switch, curiosity)
- When do you need this? (urgent vs. casual)
- What's the goal? (sound smart, actually understand, ask good questions)

**Revenue model:**
- Free: 1 course (lead gen)
- $3.99: Pay per course
- $7.99/mo: Unlimited
- $14.99/mo: Pro (certificates, more prompts)

**Unit economics:**
- Claude API cost: ~$0.50/course
- Gross margin: ~87% on $3.99 tier
- LTV: Testing now

**Tech stack:**
Next.js + Claude + Supabase + Vercel

**What I'm testing:**
- $3.99 vs $4.99 pricing
- Free tier → paid conversion rate
- Which topics drive most purchases

**Questions for IH:**
- Would you use this?
- What pricing feels right?
- Distribution ideas beyond SEO/PH?

Happy to share metrics, code, or launch process!
```

**Best Time to Post:** Wednesday-Thursday (mid-week check-in)

## Engagement Strategy

### Respond to EVERY Comment

- **Ask follow-ups:** "What topic would you generate?"
- **Offer help:** "DM me if you hit any issues"

### Seed Comments (Have Friends/Team Post)
- "Just tried it - generated a course on [topic]. Actually learned something!"
- "This is perfect for [use case]. Bookmarked."
- "How does the AI decide what to include?"

### Track Metrics
- Upvotes (aim for top 10 on smaller subs, top 50 on big ones)
- Comments (engagement signal)
- Clicks to site (use UTM params)
- Conversions from Reddit traffic

## UTM Tracking for Reddit

Use UTM parameters to track which subreddits convert:

```
https://adaptivecourses.ai?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=launch&utm_content=r_internetisbeautiful
```

Track in Plausible/PostHog:
- Which subreddits drive most traffic
- Which convert to paid users
- Which topics users generate from Reddit

---

## Success Metrics

### Per Post
- **Top 10** on subreddit (small subs)
- **Top 50** on subreddit (big subs)
- **50+ upvotes** (good signal)
- **20+ comments** (high engagement)

### Example:
Reddit post on r/indiehackers → Twitter thread about "How we got 1,000 users in Week 1" → Blog post with full metrics
