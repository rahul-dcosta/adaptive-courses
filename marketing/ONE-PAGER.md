# Adaptive Courses - One-Pager

## Elevator Pitch (15 seconds)
AI-powered courses that understand your **situation**, not just your skill level. Going to a factory tomorrow? We teach you exactly what you need. $5 per course.

## The Problem (30 seconds)
You have a factory tour tomorrow. You Google "manufacturing basics" and get:
- 47 browser tabs
- 3-hour YouTube documentaries
- Generic courses that teach you **everything**

But you don't need everything. You need **just enough** to ask smart questions and not look clueless.

## The Solution (30 seconds)
Adaptive Courses generates custom learning paths in 30 seconds using AI.

Instead of asking "What's your skill level?" we ask:
- **What's the situation?** (factory visit, job interview, career switch)
- **When do you need this?** (tomorrow, this week, no rush)
- **What's the goal?** (sound smart, ask questions, actually understand)

Then Claude generates a tailored course with modules, lessons, and quizzes.

## How It Works
1. User types topic (e.g., "manufacturing")
2. 3 button clicks (situation → timeline → goal)
3. 30-second AI generation
4. Custom course delivered

## Pricing
- **$5 per course** (one-time payment)
- No subscription, no upsells
- First 100 users: $3 with code HUNTER

## Market
**Primary:**
- Business professionals visiting clients/factories
- Job seekers prepping for interviews
- Career switchers needing quick ramp-up

**Secondary:**
- Curious learners with specific deadlines
- Students cramming for presentations
- Anyone with a "learning emergency"

## Traction
- **Pre-launch MVP** (launching Feb 3-5, 2026)

## Competition

| Competitor | Price | Depth | Speed | Personalization |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| ChatGPT | Free | Low | Fast | None |

## Business Model
- **Revenue:** $5 per course × courses sold
- **Costs:** ~$0.50 per course (Claude API + hosting)
- **Margin:** ~90% at scale
- **Break-even:** 11 courses/month

**Projections:**
- Month 1: 200 courses = $1,000 revenue
- Month 3: 1,000 courses = $5,000 revenue
- Month 6: 5,000 courses = $25,000 revenue

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Metrics to Track
- Landing page conversion (visitor → email)
- Email → paid conversion
- Course completion rate
- Referral rate
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)

**Target:** CAC < $10, LTV > $15 (1.5x+ payback)

## Roadmap

- ✅ Course generation
- ✅ Landing page
- ⏳ Payment integration
- ⏳ Email delivery
- ⏳ PDF export

**Month 2-3 (Growth):**
- User authentication
- Course templates (popular topics)
- Spaced repetition quizzes
- Social sharing

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk:** Low conversion (people try but don't pay)  
**Mitigation:** Free sample course, money-back guarantee

**Risk:** Poor course quality (AI hallucinations)  
**Mitigation:** Better prompts, human review for first 100 courses

**Risk:** High CAC (ads too expensive)  
**Mitigation:** Organic-first (Product Hunt, LinkedIn, word-of-mouth)

**Risk:** Stripe chargebacks  
**Mitigation:** Clear refund policy, quick customer support

## Launch Strategy
1. **Product Hunt** (main channel)
2. **LinkedIn** (5 posts over 7 days)
3. **Personal network** (email 50 people)
4. **Reddit/IndieHackers** (organic posts)
5. **PR outreach** (if traction is strong)

**Goal:** Top 5 on Product Hunt, 50+ courses Week 1
