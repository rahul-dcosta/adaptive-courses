## Post 1: The Problem
```
I had a factory tour in 24 hours.

I knew nothing about manufacturing.

Googling gave me 47 tabs. YouTube gave me 3-hour documentaries. ChatGPT gave me walls of text.

I needed something different.

So I built it.

Adaptive Courses: AI-generated learning that understands your SITUATION, not just your skill level.

✅ Going to a factory tomorrow? We teach you factory vocab.
✅ Job interview next week? We focus on asking good questions.
✅ Just curious? We keep it high-level.

3 button clicks. 30 seconds. A custom course.

First course is $5. No subscription. No fluff.

## Post 2: The "Aha" Moment
```
The problem with online courses:

They teach you EVERYTHING about a topic.

But you don't need everything.

You need:
→ The right depth
→ At the right time
→ For your specific situation

That's why I built Adaptive Courses.

Instead of asking "What's your skill level?" (boring)

We ask:
→ What's the situation? (visiting a factory, job interview, career switch)
→ When do you need this? (tomorrow, this week, no rush)
→ What's the goal? (sound smart, ask questions, actually understand)

Then Claude generates a custom course in 30 seconds.

No generic "beginner/intermediate/advanced" BS.

Just exactly what you need.

## Post 3: Behind the Scenes
```
I shipped Adaptive Courses in 48 hours.

Here's the stack:

Frontend: Next.js 14 + Tailwind
AI: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (course gen)
Database: Supabase
Payments: Stripe ($5/course)
Hosting: Vercel

Total cost to start: $0
First paying customer: TBD

The beauty of AI-first products:
→ No content creation team
→ No curriculum designers
→ No video production

Just a prompt, an API, and taste.

The hard part wasn't the code.

It was figuring out: What questions reveal someone's real learning need?

Turns out, "What's your skill level?" is the WRONG question.

"What's the situation?" is the RIGHT one.

## Post 4: The Testimonial (Social Proof)
```
"I had a factory tour in 24 hours. This course gave me the exact vocab I needed to not look clueless." — Sarah, Product Manager

This is why I built Adaptive Courses.

Not for people who want to "master" a topic.

For people who need to learn something FAST for a SPECIFIC reason.

The classic use cases:
→ Factory visit tomorrow (learn manufacturing basics)
→ Job interview next week (learn to ask smart questions)
→ Career switch (get conversational fast)

Each course is custom-generated by Claude in 30 seconds.

Modules. Lessons. Quizzes. Everything.

$5. One-time. No subscription.

Who's got a learning emergency? 👇
