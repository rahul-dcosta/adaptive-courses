## Full Description (Main Product Page)

### The Problem

You need to learn game theory for a strategy meeting tomorrow.

Traditional options:
- 40-hour Coursera course (don't have time)
- ChatGPT (no structure, inconsistent quality)
- YouTube tutorials (2 hours of searching for the right one)

**What if AI could generate a course tailored to YOUR exact situation?**

---

### What We Built

**Adaptive Courses** - AI-powered course generation that personalizes on 8 dimensions:

1. **Topic** - What you want to learn
2. **Prior knowledge** - Beginner → expert
3. **Learning goal** - Job interview, career development, teaching others, or just curiosity
4. **Timeline** - 30 minutes → 1 week
5. **Learning style** - Visual, hands-on, theory-first, or mixed
6. **Content format** - Examples-first vs. theory-first
7. **Challenge level** - Easy→hard progression vs. deep dive
8. **Context** - Your specific situation (factory tour, client meeting, career pivot)

**Result:** 2-module course (4-6 lessons) generated in ~60 seconds, adapted to YOU.

---

### How It Works

**1. Tell us what you need:**
- "I need to learn supply chain basics for a factory visit next week"

- "Behavioral economics for product design decisions"

**2. We ask about your context:**
- Prior knowledge (beginner → advanced)
- Timeline (30 min → 1 week)
- Learning style (visual, hands-on, reading)
- Goals (practical vs. academic)

**3. AI generates your course:**
- 2 modules, 4-6 lessons
- Tailored to your experience level
- Adapted to your timeline
- Visual diagrams for complex topics (Mermaid.js)
- Quiz questions to reinforce learning

**4. Learn and keep forever:**
- Read online or export as PDF
- Progress tracking
- Courses remain yours forever (even if you cancel subscription)

---

### Pricing

**Free:** 1 course (no credit card required)

## First Comment (Post Immediately After Launch)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We built Adaptive Courses because traditional online learning felt broken.

**The insight:** People don't need to "master" topics. They need just enough knowledge for a specific situation.

**Example:** You're visiting a factory next week and need to understand lean manufacturing. A 40-hour Coursera course is overkill. But ChatGPT lacks structure.

**What if AI could generate a 90-minute course tailored to YOUR context?**

That's what this does.

**Try it:**
- First course is free (no credit card)
- Takes 5 minutes to generate
- Test with any topic you've been meaning to learn

**Feedback wanted:**
- Would you actually use this?
- What's missing?
- What would make it 10x better?

Replying to all comments. Brutal honesty appreciated 🙏

## Maker Comment (For "Maker" Badge)

**Maker Introduction:**

Hey! We built this to solve our own problem: needing to learn specific things for specific situations.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 16, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Supabase, Stripe

**Hardest part:** Getting AI to generate consistently structured, high-quality content across diverse topics.

**Proud of:** The "learner fingerprinting" system - 8 dimensions of personalization vs. just "skill level"

Happy to answer any tech questions or discuss the AI prompting strategy 👇

## Response Templates (For Comments)

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"**

Great question! ChatGPT is amazing for Q&A but not structured learning.

Differences:
- Structured curriculum (modules → lessons → quizzes)
- Progress tracking
- Coherent learning path (each lesson builds on previous)
- Visual diagrams (Mermaid.js rendering)
- Printable/saveable

Think of it as ChatGPT + course structure + persistence.

---

**"$3.99 seems too cheap. Why not charge more?"**

Intentional. We're targeting the "impulse buy" psychology:
- Below $5 mental accounting threshold
- Same as a coffee (easy to justify)
- Still 81% gross margin (sustainable)

Goal is volume + low friction. Subscription ($9.99/mo) is the upsell for power users.

---

**"What if the AI generates wrong information?"**

Valid concern. We:
1. Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best-in-class for accuracy)
2. Add disclaimers about verifying critical info
3. Include sources/references where applicable

Quality is on par with human-written courses for structured knowledge (frameworks, processes, technical topics).

Not recommended for: Medical advice, legal advice, cutting-edge research.

---

**"Will this replace teachers/educators?"**

No. Different use case.

Teachers: Deep learning, mentorship, accountability, creativity
Adaptive Courses: Just-in-time knowledge for specific situations

We're solving for "I need to understand X for Y situation tomorrow" - not formal education.

---

**"How do you prevent spam/abuse of free tier?"**

- 1 free course per email
- Device fingerprinting (light tracking)
- Email verification required

If abuse becomes a problem, we'll tighten. But so far beta users have been respectful.

---

**"What's your moat? OpenAI could launch this tomorrow."**

Fair. Our moat isn't tech - it's:
1. Learner fingerprinting (8 dimensions of personalization)
2. Prompt engineering (took months to get right)
3. "Keep forever" trust differentiator
4. Pricing (accessible to individuals)

If OpenAI launches, we'll compete on UX and customer trust.
