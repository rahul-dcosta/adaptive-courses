**The case for personalized, just-in-time learning**

Most corporate learning programs optimize for compliance, not effectiveness.

You're assigned a 40-hour course on "Supply Chain Management" when you just need to understand lean manufacturing for a factory visit next week.

The disconnect:
- Learning platforms: One-size-fits-all courses
- Real professionals: Specific knowledge needs for specific situations

**The gap:** Just-in-time learning adapted to context.

---

We built Adaptive Courses to address this. Here's how it works:

**1. Context-first personalization**

Instead of just asking "What's your skill level?" we ask:
- What's your goal? (job interview, client meeting, career development)
- What's your timeline? (30 minutes vs. 1 week)
- What's your situation? (factory tour, strategy presentation, technical implementation)

**2. AI-generated curriculum**

Using Claude (Anthropic's latest model), we generate 2-module courses tailored to:
- Your prior knowledge
- Your learning style (visual, hands-on, theory-first)
- Your immediate application (real examples from your domain)

**3. Efficient delivery**

- 30-90 minute read time (not 40 hours)
- Visual diagrams for complex topics
- Practical takeaways, not just theory
- Content you own forever (no subscription lock-in)

---

**Early results:**

Beta testers report:
- 68% completion rate (vs. ~15% for MOOCs)
- 72% finish within stated time estimate
- Immediate application in meetings/projects

**Use cases we've seen:**
- Marketing exec learning factory operations before plant tour
- Product manager studying game theory for pricing decisions
- Engineer learning async programming for specific project
- Consultant preparing for client meeting in unfamiliar industry

---

**Business model:**

- First course: Free
- Per-course: $3.99 (impulse-accessible)
- Pro subscription: $9.99/month unlimited

Why $3.99? It's:
- Below the $5 "mental accounting" threshold
- 95% cheaper than alternatives (Coursera, Skillshare, Udemy)
- Sustainable (81% gross margin)
- Accessible to individual professionals, not just companies

---

**The insight:**

People don't need to "master" topics. They need just enough knowledge for the task at hand.

AI makes personalized, on-demand curriculum generation economically viable for the first time.

This changes what's possible in professional development.

## Alternative: Shorter LinkedIn Post (If Main Is Too Long)

**Just-in-time learning > just-in-case learning**

Traditional courses assume you have 40 hours to master a topic.

Reality: You have 2 hours to understand enough for tomorrow's meeting.

We built Adaptive Courses to solve this:
- AI-generated courses adapted to YOUR context
- 30-90 minute read time
- First course free

Not trying to replace formal education. Trying to serve the 80% of learning that's situational and time-sensitive.

## Alternative: Insight-Driven Post (No Product Pitch)

**Why most online learning has a 15% completion rate**

It's not laziness. It's misaligned incentives.

**Courses optimize for:** Comprehensive knowledge, academic rigor, "mastery"

**Learners need:** Specific knowledge, immediate application, efficiency

**Example:**

You need to learn game theory for a negotiation tomorrow.

Traditional course:
- 40 hours of content
- Starts with history and academic foundations
- Takes 3 weeks if you're dedicated

What you actually need:
- 90 minutes of content
- Nash equilibrium + prisoner's dilemma with business examples
- Practical tactics for tomorrow

**The problem:** Creating personalized courses for every use case doesn't scale.

**The solution:** AI-generated curriculum that adapts to:
- Your timeline (30 min → 1 week)
- Your goal (interview prep vs. deep understanding)
- Your context (factory tour, client meeting, career pivot)

This is now economically viable. Generation cost: ~$0.34 per course.

**Implications:**

1. Corporate L&D can offer personalized paths at scale
2. Professionals can learn just-in-time, not just-in-case
3. Completion rates go from 15% → 60%+ (our early data)

**POSTING STRATEGY:**

**When to post:**
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am ET or 12-1pm ET
- Avoid: Monday (inbox overload), Friday (people check out), weekends

**Engagement:**
- Respond to every comment within 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions (drive conversation)
- Tag relevant people if they comment (keeps thread alive)
- Share insights, not sales pitches in comments

**Profile optimization (before posting):**
- Headline: "Building adaptive learning solutions" (not "Founder at Adaptive Courses" - H1B)
- About section: Mention the company, not role
- Featured: Link to adaptivecourses.com

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use excessive emojis (max 1-2)
- Don't say "I'm so excited to share..."
- Don't ask people to "check out my startup"
- Don't use #StartupLife or #Entrepreneurship (cringe)
- Don't mention founder title (H1B compliance)

**Professional but not corporate:**
- Use data and insights
- Share real use cases
- Invite critical feedback
- Avoid hype language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "disrupting")
- Be helpful, not salesy
