- **Be helpful, not defensive**
- **Admit flaws honestly**
- **Ask follow-up questions**
- **Thank people for feedback**

### Common Objections (Prepare Responses)

**"Why not just use ChatGPT?"**
> Great question! ChatGPT is amazing for Q&A, but lacks structure. We add: modules, lessons, progress tracking, visual diagrams, and coherent learning paths. Think ChatGPT + course structure.

**"AI-generated content will be low quality."**
> Fair concern. We use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (same model writing production code). Quality matches human courses for structured knowledge. Not good for: lived experience, cutting-edge research. Try the free course and judge for yourself.

**"$3.99 is too cheap. Why not charge more?"**
> Intentional. We're targeting impulse-buy psychology: below $5 threshold, same as coffee, but 81% margin. Volume + low friction. $9.99/mo subscription is the upsell.

**"What's your moat?"**
> Honest answer: Not the tech. Our moat is learner fingerprinting (8 dimensions), prompt engineering (months of tuning), "keep forever" trust, and accessible pricing. If big players enter, we compete on UX and trust.

**"How do you prevent spam/abuse?"**
> 1 free course per email, device fingerprinting, email verification. If abuse grows, we'll tighten. Beta users have been respectful so far.

## 🚫 What NOT to Do (H1B Compliance)

### NEVER:
- ❌ Mention founder/personal name in posts
- ❌ Say "I built this" (use "we built this")
- ❌ List yourself as "Founder/CEO" anywhere
- ❌ Use personal email for support
- ❌ Sign contracts or legal documents publicly

### ALWAYS:
- ✅ Use company name: "Adaptive Courses" or "we"
- ✅ Support email: support@adaptivecourses.com
- ✅ Refer to "the company" or "the team"
- ✅ Keep personal identity separate from business

### Why This Matters:
**H1B visa compliance** - Any public operational role could jeopardize immigration status. Maintain "passive investor" narrative at all times.
