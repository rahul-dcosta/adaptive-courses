## Tweet 1: Problem → Solution (Thread)

**Tweet 1/5:**
Most online courses ask: "What's your skill level?"

Wrong question.

The real question: "What's your situation?"

A thread on why personalized learning needs to go deeper than "beginner/intermediate/advanced" 🧵

**Tweet 2/5:**
Example: Two people want to learn game theory.

Person A: Studying for an academic exam (needs rigor, proofs, citations)

Person B: Preparing for salary negotiation tomorrow (needs practical tactics, real examples)

Same topic. Completely different needs.

**Tweet 3/5:**
Traditional courses can't handle this.

They optimize for ONE learner profile:
- Motivated student
- Unlimited time
- Generic goals

But most real learners:
- Need just enough for a specific task
- Have 2 hours, not 40
- Want practical, not comprehensive

**Tweet 4/5:**
AI changes this.

Now you can generate a course adapted to:
- Your prior knowledge
- Your timeline (30 min → 1 week)
- Your goal (job interview vs. deep learning)
- Your context (factory visit, client meeting, career switch)

In 60 seconds.

**Tweet 5/5:**
We built this: [adaptivecourses.com]

Enter a topic + your situation.
AI generates a personalized course.

First one's free. Try it and tell us if it actually works.

Trying to make learning less "one-size-fits-all" and more "just-in-time."

## Tweet 2: Pricing Insight (Single Tweet)

The $3.99 price point is underrated.

It's:
- Below the $5 "mental accounting" threshold
- Same as a coffee (easy to justify)
- High enough to filter low-intent users
- Low enough to buy impulsively

And at 81% gross margin? Scales beautifully.

"Coffee price" products >>> subscriptions for impulse buys.

## Tweet 3: Comparison Hook (Thread)

**Tweet 1/4:**
Coursera: $59/mo
Skillshare: $32/mo
Udemy courses: $20-200 each

All give you the SAME course as everyone else.

We charge $3.99 and generate a course adapted to YOUR situation.

Here's why personalization at scale changes everything 🧵

**Tweet 2/4:**
Traditional courses:
- 40 hours of content (you need 10 min)
- Generic examples (doesn't match your context)
- One difficulty level (too easy or too hard)

Adaptive Courses:
- 30-90 min (just what you need)
- Examples from YOUR domain
- Matched to YOUR experience level

**Tweet 3/4:**
How it works:

1. You enter: "Supply chain basics for factory tour next week"
2. AI asks about your background (marketing, never studied operations)
3. Generates 2-module course with diagrams, real factory examples
4. You read it in 90 minutes, feel confident

Cost: $3.99. Keep forever.

**Tweet 4/4:**
This is the future of learning:

Not generic courses for everyone.
Personalized courses generated on-demand.

(First course is free. See if it actually works for your use case.)

## Tweet 4: Mermaid Diagrams Feature (Single Tweet with Image)

Hot take: Learning complex topics without diagrams is like reading IKEA instructions without pictures.

We added Mermaid.js rendering to course generation.

Now AI generates:
- Flowcharts
- Sequence diagrams  
- System architecture
- Process flows

Makes learning 10x faster.

## Tweet 5: Use Case Showcase (Thread)

**Tweet 1/6:**
Real use cases from beta testers:

AI-generated courses aren't just for "learning."

They're for professionals who need specific knowledge for specific situations.

Here's what people are actually using this for 🧵

**Tweet 2/6:**
**Use case 1: The Factory Visit**

"I'm a marketer visiting a Toyota factory next week. Need to understand lean manufacturing enough to ask smart questions."

Course generated:
- Visual learner mode (diagrams)
- 90-minute read
- Focused on observation, not theory

Result: Productive visit.

**Tweet 3/6:**
**Use case 2: The Job Interview**

"I have a consulting interview and need to understand game theory well enough to discuss it for 5-10 minutes."

Course generated:
- Key frameworks (Nash equilibrium, prisoner's dilemma)
- Business examples (not academic)
- Talking points, not deep proofs

**Tweet 4/6:**
**Use case 3: The Career Pivot**

"I'm a Python developer learning TypeScript for a new job. Need async/await explained for someone who knows Python async."

Course generated:
- Comparison approach (Python vs. TypeScript)
- Code examples in both languages
- Practical, not comprehensive

**Tweet 5/6:**
**Use case 4: The Client Meeting**

"I need to explain blockchain to a skeptical client tomorrow. Need pros/cons, use cases, and when NOT to use it."

Course generated:
- Balanced perspective (not crypto-bro hype)
- Business use cases (supply chain, not DeFi)
- When NOT to use it (critical for credibility)

**Tweet 6/6:**
Pattern: People don't want to "master" topics.

They want just enough knowledge for a specific situation.

AI makes this possible.

## Bonus: "Keep Forever" Differentiator

We're not holding your education hostage.

Novel concept: You pay for it, you own it.

## Bonus: AI Quality Callout

"Won't AI-generated courses be low quality?"

Fair question.

We use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (same model that writes production code).

Quality is on par with human-written courses for:
- Structured knowledge (frameworks, processes)
- Technical topics (programming, systems)
- Business concepts (strategy, economics)

What it's NOT good for:
- Lived experience (AI can't replace memoir)
- Cutting-edge research (too new for training data)

But for 80% of learning? It works.

Try it and judge for yourself: [adaptivecourses.com]
